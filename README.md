**Why are you using TypeScript?**

The only reason why I am using TypeScript is for its type system. TypeScript almost looks like documenation mixed in with the code so it helps me understand how things work a little faster. I have always struggled with understanding how React works and why other developers use it and if TypeScript is going to expedite my overall understanding, why not?

**Why a starter kit?**

I love to tinker with different libraries and frameworks and I find myself spending more time setting up a simple dev environment than actually tinkering. This repository will act as a way for me to skip the dev environment BS so that I can focus on whatever it is I am experimenting with in the React "ecosystem"

**Why "Kurage"?**

Kurage means "jellyfish" in Japanese. It is memorable :)
